# newsScrape

##  a mongo New York Times news scraping website, optimized with Cheerio, Node, Express, Handlebars, morgan, and body-parser

### I wanted to do this assignment using Handlebars instead of using React as a refresher of sorts. I've been doing tutorials and demos mainly in React since starting project 2, so I wanted to challenge myself and do this in Handlebars. I ran into trouble mainly with trying to get Handlebars to work correctly. I spent Thursday night, all day friday, and the rest of saturday trying to hack it out. As of now, the app wont run correctly. I'm not sure why. I'll try to fix it before y'all grade it!
